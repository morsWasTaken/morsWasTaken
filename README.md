## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Kostas
#### I am interested in Kotlin/Java projects. My aim is to become a successful Android Developer. I'm currently learning Kotlin/Jetpack Compose UI toolkit. I am looking to collaborate on various projects in order to gain some experience both on Android or outside of it.
